These matlab/octave scripts will solve the 1D heat eqn under different 
conditions, as prescribed in the driver script, "deb.m"

 deb.m       - driver
 eb.m        - run the unsteady heat eqn with Euler Backward
 a_var.m     - set up the A matrix for variable (here, Chebyshev) grid spacing

To use this, simply run "deb" ... assuming that all 3 files are in the working
directory.

You can edit "a_var.m" to change to uniform dx, if you so desire. 
(Just uncomment the appropriate line near the top of the file.)

Your task is to create a _new_ script, "cn.m" that will implement CN 
timestepping instead of EB and then to test to verify that it yields
the expected behavior, etc.
