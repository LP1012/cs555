These matlab/octave scripts will solve the 2D heat eqn under different 
conditions, as prescribed in the driver script, "tst_h2d.m"
and corresponding timestepping code, "heat2d.m"

tst_h2d.m    - driver
heat2d.m     - main 2D timestepper code
hdr.m        - convenient plotting abbreviations

To use this, simply run "tst_h2d" ... assuming that all 3 files 
are in the working directory.

You can edit "tst_h2d.m" to change spacing, timestep sizes, etc.

Your tasks are to modify heat2d.m for each of the questions.
(For code cleanliness, I suggest to _not_ put all changes into a single
file, but it might be possible...)
